#Merge sort without recursion

This is a small project of mine made in order to practice a little bit of the **C** programing language and keep deliberatly programming aside from college homework. The idea is to create a version of the mergesort algorithm without the use of recursion.

##Mergesort recap

The mergesort algo is one of the first algos introduced in order to explain the concept of divide and conquer; stable sorting and **O( n * log( n ) )** sorting.
